Many problems in functional analysis can be formed in the pattern solving 
\begin{equation}
    F(u) = 0, 
\end{equation}
where $u$ is in a Banach space $V$.

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two normed vector space and $U \in X$ is a open subset 
of $V$. A function $f: U \to Y$ is called Fréchet-differentiable at $x$ if 
there exists a bounded linear operator $A: X \to Y$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \lim _{\norm{h} \to 0} \frac{\norm{f(x+h) - f(x) - Ah}_X}
    {\norm{h}_V} = 0.
\end{equation}
We write $D f(x) = A$ and call it the Fréchet derivative of $f$ at $x$.
The directional (Gateaux-) derivative of $f$ at $x$ in the direction $v$ 
is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    D_vf(x) = \inp{v}{Df(x)}.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}
